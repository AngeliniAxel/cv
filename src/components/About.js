        Redirecting my career to programming. I took a FullStack developer
        course and despite not having experience working in that field yet, I
        consider myself a person with a great ability to acquire new knowledge,
        through practice and learning from colleagues who have more experience
        than me. I have no doubt that if you give me the opportunity to prove
        it, I will be able to adapt quickly to the way you work at your company.
        I have experience in Javascript (ES6), React, Redux, Node.js,
        Express.js, Postgresql, HTML5, CSS3, responsive design, Bootstrap, and
        Iâ€™m constantly learning. I can speak fluently in English. I enjoy
        working in a team and learning new things every day. Outside the scope
        of programming, I use my free time to work out, play videogames or read
        comics.
